	<h4>(Do you know the way?)</h4>

	<p>Description </p>

	<h2>This project was inspired by the philosophical problem, the Trolley Dilemma.  The concept of this project is that everyone's life is different because there are many choices in life, but they all have the same destination, which is death. No matter which way you go, your time would be less and less.  THe project was done with Photoshop as a collage with over 20 images. </h2>
