	<h1>Artist Statement</h1>

	<h2>	My name is Pak Wong. I am currently a studnet at San Jose State University. I am currently a studio practice major now but I will be in the BFA pictorial program begining in Fall 2018. The reason I am trying to get into the BFA program is that I believe it will help me to develop my art style and to prepare me to engage in the art world. </h2>

	<h2>	Throughtout my college career, I am passionate about painting and drawing.  Not only that, I am also looking after the drawing and painting skill of artworks.  In my drawing and painting classes, I have slowly and slowly developed skills that I wish to obtain that I mentioned.  And I believe that my goal (to reach a higher skill level) can be, and can only be done by repeating of practices.  Besides traditional drawing and painting, I also do work in various medium.  From traditional painting, to video editing, to code art such as net art.  As shown, my works somewhat share a similar characteristic, which is that they have simple buy relevant ideas, but those idea are executed in abstract, experimental ways.   </h2>
